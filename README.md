# HOGWILD
A survey of HOGWILD, as seen in [Niu et al.'s paper in
2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5730).

## TODO

- Implement HOGWILD for regression over the wine-quality dataset. (Fr)
- Implement HOGWILD for linear SVM over some interesting data set. (Fr)
- Produce strong and weak scaling numerical studies for the project. (Sa)
- Produce convergence numerical studies for the project. (Sa)
- State and prove theorems on the convergence of HOGWILD. (Su-Th)
- Discuss and potentially implement improvement of HOGWILD. (Su-Th)
