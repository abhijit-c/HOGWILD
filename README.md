# HOGWILD
A survey of HOGWILD, as seen in [Niu et al.'s paper in
2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5730). See the paper in the Report directory
for the the actual project. *Warning:* Due to a lack of time, the code in
Testing is very, very, hardcoded and raw, I'm pretty embarressed by it. I'll be
cleaning it up in the next few days in an initiative to incorporate the
CYCLADES variation of HOGWILD into this repository.
